About   
========

	Owondump is a userspace USB driver that interrogates an Owon PDS digital oscilloscope
	over the USB bus, and retrieves a trace memory for all selected channels. The downloaded
	data is made available on the PC in both vectorgram format and in the bitmap BMP format.

	Owondump was originally designed for the 25MHz PDS5022s "Academic" Scope from Owon, but
	it probably works for other scopes in the same range. 
	
	Owondump was originally intended for *nix machines since the manufacturer only provides
	a closed-source binary for Microsoft Windows and, worse, that binary won't even run in
	WINE. However, it should also be possible to build Owondump against libusb-win32, the
	Windows port of the library.   
	
	Once the channel vectorgram data has been retrieved from the scope, it is parsed into a
	tabulated text file format that can be displayed using GNUplot or similar plotting packages.

Concluding Notes	
================

	The human-readable vectorgram file format produced by Owondump exactly mirrors the format produced by the
	original Windows s/w from Owon / Lilliput Technologies.   This format works fine when the scope channels
	are all configured to use the same timebase. However when channel #1 is set to 5nS and channel #2 is set
	to 100mS, for example, the tabulated sample data cannot be plotted sensibly.
	
	Ideally, the tabulated data should have a text header that details the timebase settings for each of the
	channels. This header would then be parsed by the trace plotting package.

	The Owon seems a bit quirky. If the device is not reset before a transfer is made, the data toggle for
	the BULK IN endpoint gets stuck, and cannot be shifted. Without that reset, the BULK IN transfers would
	otherwise timeout. 

	All comments welcomed!
